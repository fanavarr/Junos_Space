Issue: log collector out of disk Space.

> df -kh  --this will show your actual disk space.
> find / -xdev -type f -printf '%s %p\n'| sort -nr | head -50    --this will show the top 50 heavier files.

Deleting Diskrollover logs

> find / -name Diskrollover.log             --can be deleted
> find / -name Diskrollover.log.backup      --can be deleted

Checking the LC node(s)

> ls /var/lib/elasticsearch/log-collector/nodes 
Should be only one node: 0  if there is another node: 1 go to:
> cd /var/lib/elasticsearch/log-collector/nodes/1/indices
> ls
If the upper command show logs on the current directory you may move them to node 0 or wipe the whole 1 directory if you dont need them.
> service elasticsearch stop
> service logstash stop
> mv * /var/lib/elasticsearch/log-collector/nodes/0/indices
> cd /var/lib/elasticsearch/log-collector/nodes/
> rm -rf 1
Fixing the double node issue:
> vi /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml    --vi knowledge needed
Change the index.number_of_shards: from 2 to 1
> service elasticsearch start
> service logstash start

Delete older logs:
> cd /var/log
> ls
Remove older logs, eg: KEEP maillog  and delete maillog-20170319  and so on.
> service elasticsearch stop
> service logstash stop
> service elasticsearch start
> service logstash start
