Issue: Log Collector not receiving data.

Check Network settings on Space,LC and whatever is supposed to send the data eg:srx, make sure you can ping and ssh both ways.

> df -kh --to check disk space, no disk space means no logs.  

Tcpdump is your friend:

On Log Collector:
> tcpdump –i eth0 –vv –s 0 port 514              --check data un syslog port
> tcpdump –i eth0 –vv –s 0 host W.X.Y.Z          --data sender IP address

On Space:
> tcpdump –i eth0 –vv –s 0 host W.X.Y.Z          --Loc Collector IP addres

Traffic should be displayed if any, if do not know how to read tcpdum RTFM!.
If not data being received from the sender device, eg:srx, check for the proper syslog / security log configuration.

Checking services:
> service elasticsearch status
> service logstash status

Checking the Log Collector config files:
> cat /etc/hosts
> cat /etc/sysconfig/network
The hostname on hosts file should match the HOSTNAME value on network file.
> cat /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
Make sure the log collector IP address is on line http.basic.ipwhitelist: ["localhost", "127.0.0.1"]
eg: http.basic.ipwhitelist: ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", W.X.Y.Z"] 

Restart of services:
> service elasticsearch stop
> service logstash stop
> service elasticsearch start
> service logstash start
