Issue, space showing ERROR: There are jobs pending.

Go to Space CLI, debugging mode (option 7)

The following are mysql queries, they are case sensitive.

> mysql -u jboss -pnetscreen build_db;
# select * from JobInstance where moState='SCHEDULED';
# select * from JobInstance where moState='INPROGRESS';
# select * from JobInstance where moState='STARTING';
# select * from JobInstance where moState='CANCELLING';
# update JobInstance set jobStatus=4,jobState=4,scheduledStartTime=NULL,pendingJobState=NULL,pendingJobStatus=NULL,moState="CANCELLED" where moState='SCHEDULED';

# select * from JobInstance where moState='SCHEDULED';

Exit mysql, error should be fixed.
